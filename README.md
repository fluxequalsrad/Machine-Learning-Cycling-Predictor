# Weather Dependent Cycling Predictor

I don't want to say I'm a fair weather cyclist but my days of riding through heavy rain or having to combat brutal headwinds in the name of fitness are reaching an end. Using weather data sourced from the Australian Bureau of Meterology along with my personal cycling data retrieved from Strava, I have developed a model that can review the upcoming weather forecast and predict which days I am most likely to go riding.
